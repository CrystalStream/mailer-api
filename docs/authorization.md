# Authorization

Authorization is a separate service from authentication.

Authorization is permission-based with those permissions being assigned to _roles_ and those roles being assigned to users. This layer of abstraction ensures that we handle API permissions correctly while allowing proper users to manage roles and which users have access to those roles.
